# FTDMamba

This is the official implementation of FTDMamba: Frequency-Assisted Temporal Dilation Mamba for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Video Anomaly Detection.

Our work primarily focuses on video anomaly detection in UAV videos under dynamic backgrounds, while also being applicable to UAV videos under static backgrounds.

The code and new dataset will be publicly available!
